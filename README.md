Started by jimyuyuyi@gmail.com, 2014-08-19

A light-weight line graph rendering Javascript library for web-site graphs.
Built for fastest preformance to render massive amount of data points (eg. annual data at 1 minute granularity), with minimal memory usage.


Contains built-in basic statistics (min,max,average,percentile) options.
_loopx functions are designed to allow progress % updates, and to avoid IE 8- browsers becoming non-responsive.

Inspiration: Dygraph Line graphing library.
This library seeks to surpass it in terms of efficency and preformance, at the cost of less features.
Benchmark: 500K data size for 2 groups rendered in 80 seconds, 1840 seconds for IE8- using excanvas.
